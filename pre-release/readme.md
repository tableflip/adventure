This mirco-service is for capturing the details of a TABLEFLIP release for testing. The service provides the webform and endpoint for the data collected by the form.

## Getting started

You'll need to run a node 8. Navigate to the folder and `npm install` then you can run a reloading server to develop on using `npm run watch`. You can run the tests with `npm test` (they need node 8 too).

1) npm install (node 6+)
2) npm run watch
3) npm test
